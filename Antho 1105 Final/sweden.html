                <p>When most people think of Sweden, they think of the Viking Age which is recorded as between 800 - 1050 AD. However modern humans have been settling in Sweden as far recorded as the Stone age. It is believed that Sweden became populated sometime between 8,000 and 6,000 BC. And although little is known about ancient these communities, artifacts show consistent habituation until as late as 1,800 BC. This slightly overlaps with the Bronze Age (3,300 to 1,200 BC) when nordic culture first started to emerge. In regards to the Viking Age, during this period Vikings were known for plundering and trading with European and Arab kingdoms. Sweden would debut as a traditional nation in 1000 AD, but wouldn’t gain popularity amongst its European neighbors until adopting feudalism 1000 years later.<a class="citation" href="https://sweden.se/culture/history/history-of-sweden#">[i]</a></p>

                <p>Sweden's political structure is characterized by <div class="highlight">social democracy</div>, which combines elements of capitalism and socialism. This political ideology <div class="highlight">emphasizes democratic collective action and rejects the laissez-faire</div> sentiment that governments should refrain from interfering with private industry. (U.S feeling attacked?) Private industry trade still exist but is largely regulated by their federal government. <div class="highlight">Robert Heilborner,</div> an American intellectual awarded summa cum laude when graduating from Harvard with a degree in philosophy, government and economics, describes his perfect society as an idealized Sweden, yet  refutes the Sweden's claim of a social democracy instead accusing them of overt capitalist. <a class="citation" href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1980/12/04/the-swedish-promise/">[i]</a> <a class="citation" href="https://americancompass.org/is-sweden-a-free-market-welfare-state/">[i]</a></p>

               <p>Sweden's GDP for 2022 was just over $56k per capita, with a population of 10.49million. Just as a reminder, <div class="highlight">Gross Domestic Product per capita is a measure of the total goods and services produced by a country, averaged against its population. The Gini Coefficient Index ranks the distribution of wealth within a country from 0 (pure equality) to 100 (extreme inequality)</div>. Sweden's Gini index for 2021 was 29.8. Sweden’s current <div class="highlight">unemployment rate</div> for 2021 was 7.39%. Which is nowhere near high but relatively speaking, not absurdly low. 3 - 5 % is considered a safe unemployment range to offset inflation, yet anything 5% suggests virtual full employment across the population.

                <p>Following economic crisis (1980s-90) Sweden developed a very concise <div class="highlight">budget policy:</div> Budget work is based on a top-down perspective, working with an established budget first and making modifications only when there are sufficient funds available. This established budget must include all income and expenditures, including other payments such as possible debts that affect the borrowing needs of the central government. In order to expand the budget within one area the cost must be covered by price cuts in another area. Essentially, if the goal is to spend more money in education or healthcare, funding must be saved by shifting money around within the same category rather than taking it from somewhere else entirely.<br><br> A <div class="highlight">debt anchor</div> has also been established. This entails that the consolidated gross debt for the entire government sector is benchmarked at 35% of GDP. If for whatever reason the debt surpasses the benchmark by 5%, 40% of the GDP, the government must provide a report including justification and plans to manage the deviation. This system is designed to give the general public more access to actively participate in the economy. <a class="citation" href="https://www.government.se/government-of-sweden/ministry-of-finance/central-government-budget/the-fiscal-policy-framework/#:~:text=Budget%20work%20is%20based%20on,ceiling%20and%20the%20surplus%20target.">[i]</a> <br><br>
                Further <div class="highlight">Swedish welfare programs</div> are renowned for their reflecting the country's commitment to social equality and economic security. Swedes generally accept high taxes as a means to fund welfare programs and ensure social solidarity.<br><br><br> A few of Sweden's public welfare programs are: (1) Universal Healthcare (2) Comparably affordable higher education. Free primary & secondary schooling  (3) Subsidized childcare, generous parental leave, and govt. funded child allowances</p>
