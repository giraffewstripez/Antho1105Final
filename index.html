            <p>For the final assignment I plan to compare the socio-economic relationships of Sweden and South Africa. Sweden is ranked 18th in global GDP/capita and has a Gini index of 29.8. South Africa is ranked 36th in global GDP/capita and has a Gini index of 63.0. Despite both countries maintaining a relatively high global GDP ranking, wealth inequality appears to be far more rampant in South Africa. Iâ€™m interested to find out how citizens are allowed to interact with economic policy and the cultural perspective on money in both regions.<br><br>I chose a website formate that would allow me to directly link sources for cited information, and to provide visual compnents to enhance audience understanding of the analysis.
