                <p>It is a known fact that the oldest artifacts linked to modern humans have been discovered and dated in Africa. Modern civilizations began to emerge throughout the African continent roughly 300,000 years ago. With that being said there is little known about the origins of South Africa's indigenous community. Prior to colonialism South Africa was not a country. The region was initially home to multiple diverse kingdoms; today these indigenous groups are commonly represented by the San, Khoikhoi, Bantu-speaking communities. These kingdoms are believed to have traded primarily with other African civilizations and due to its geographical location remained secluded from foreign civilizations. The Portuguese arrived first in 1488 and by 1652 the Dutch East India Company had established a camp. This reality was filled with conflict as the European settlers displayed an open disregard towards the existing kingdoms and were openly hostile. By the 18th century the British had arrived, and conflict erupted between opposing groups of settlers as well as the indigenous communities. By the 19th century the British had defeated the last of the Dutch and established themselves as colonial rulers of the entire region which is known today as South Africa. In 1910, South Africa would gain its independence, however it would unfortunately be led by an Apartheid administration until 1994 when it transitioned into democracy.</p>

                <p>South Africa's political ideology reflects its complex history and diverse population. A significant aspect of South Africa's socio-political landscape is its commitment to democracy, which emerged following the end of apartheid in 1994. South Africa incorporates elements of socialism and capitalism into its political ideology, however many believe South Africa's government to be corrupt.<br><br>"Even though the Apartheid regime had begun to unravel in the 1980s, the majority blacks remained deprived of basic political and economic freedoms. Given the depth of the racial and income divides that prevailed, it would not have been unreasonable to predict a cycle of redistribution and macroeconomic populism after democratization, wreaking havoc with the economy and turning the country into a sham democracy" <a class="citation" href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/understanding-south-africa.pdf">[i]</a></p>

               <p>Unemployment is a persistent challenge in South Africa, with implications for poverty, inequality, and social stability. The country's unemployment rate, which stood at 32.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, remains high despite reported government efforts to stimulate job creation. <a class="citation" href="https://www.wits.ac.za/news/latest-news/opinion/2023/2023-09/south-africa-cant-crack-the-inequality-curse-why-and-what-can-be-done.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20most%20recent,value%20between%200%20and%201.">[i]</a>

                <p>Since its transition to democracy South Africa's economic performance has been quite underwhelming <a class="citation" href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/understanding-south-africa.pdf">[i]</a>South Africa’s 2022 GDP/Per capita was 6k, with a population of 58 million. The Gini index places South Africa as 63 out of 100, with 100 representing extreme wealth inequality, 63 reflect how much of the population resides in poverty.<br><br>South Africa does have welfare programs aimed at addressing poverty and providing social assistance to vulnerable populations, however the effectiveness of these programs have been the subject of debate and criticism. Administration of social grants has been plagued by challenges such as corruption, inefficiency, and delays in payment. Some critics say that these programs are stunted due to half of the nations population being unable to contribute to tax income. However sentiments for taxes remain mixed and stunted due to the almost invisible turn around.
